# 000 - Example Task

**Epic:** Example Epic  
**Created:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Planning

## Overview

This is an example plan document that shows the structure and content that should be included when planning a new task in Composer/Plan Mode.

- **Brief description**: Demonstrates the task documentation structure
- **Problem it solves**: Provides a template for future task planning
- **User story**: As a developer, I want to see an example of task documentation so I can understand the expected format

## Architecture

### Components Affected
- `.cursor/tasks/` - New documentation system
- `.cursor/coding_rule.mdc` - Updated with new rules

### New Files to Create
- Plan document (this file)
- Summary document (after implementation)
- Supporting code files as needed

### Files to Modify
- Existing configuration files if needed
- Related test files

### Dependencies Required
- List any new packages or dependencies
- Example: `pytest`, `fastapi`, etc.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Create directory structure
   - Initialize configuration
   - Set up testing environment

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Implement main functionality
   - Add error handling
   - Write unit tests

3. **Integration Phase**
   - Integrate with existing systems
   - Add integration tests
   - Update documentation

4. **Testing Strategy for Each Step**
   - Unit tests after each component
   - Integration tests after phase 2
   - End-to-end tests after phase 3

## API Changes (if applicable)

### New Endpoints
```python
POST /api/v1/example
GET /api/v1/example/{id}
PUT /api/v1/example/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/example/{id}
```

### Request Schema
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "metadata": {
    "key": "value"
  }
}
```

### Response Schema
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "created_at": "2025-10-30T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Required
- Test each function/method in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Target: 90%+ code coverage

### Integration Tests Required
- Test API endpoints end-to-end
- Test database interactions
- Test event publishing/consuming
- Verify error handling across components

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the application
2. Test happy path scenarios
3. Test error scenarios
4. Verify logs and monitoring
5. Check performance metrics

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All unit tests pass
