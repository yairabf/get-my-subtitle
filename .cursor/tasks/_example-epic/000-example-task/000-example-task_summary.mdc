# 000 - Example Task - Implementation Summary

**Epic:** Example Epic  
**Completed:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Implemented

### Files Created
- `.cursor/tasks/` - Task documentation directory structure
- `.cursor/tasks/README.md` - Documentation system guide
- `.cursor/tasks/_example-epic/000-example-task/000-example-task_plan.mdc` - Example plan
- `.cursor/tasks/_example-epic/000-example-task/000-example-task_summary.mdc` - Example summary (this file)

### Files Modified
- `.cursor/coding_rule.mdc` - Added Composer/Plan Mode documentation rules

### Actual Implementation vs. Plan
- ✅ Created directory structure as planned
- ✅ Added comprehensive rules to coding_rule.mdc
- ✅ Created example templates
- ✅ Added README with usage guide
- ✅ Followed all naming conventions

## Deviations from Plan

### Changes Made During Implementation
1. Added underscore prefix to example epic (`_example-epic`) to keep it separate from real epics
2. Enhanced README with more detailed workflow explanation
3. Added quick start guide to README

### Reasons for Deviations
- Better organization: Examples should be clearly distinguished from real tasks
- Better UX: More detailed documentation helps onboarding
- Practicality: Quick start reduces friction when starting new tasks

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
- N/A - Documentation system, no code to test

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Verified directory structure is created correctly
- ✅ Confirmed file naming follows conventions
- ✅ Validated markdown rendering

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Created example epic and task directories
- ✅ Verified kebab-case naming works correctly
- ✅ Confirmed `.mdc` files are readable
- ✅ Checked that structure is intuitive

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Clear structure makes it easy to organize tasks by epic
- Separation of plan and summary provides good workflow
- Using `.mdc` extension works well with Cursor
- Kebab-case naming is consistent and readable

### What Could Be Improved
- Consider adding a CLI tool to automate task creation
- Could add task status tracking (planned, in-progress, completed, blocked)
- Might want to add links between related tasks
- Consider adding a table of contents for each epic

### Technical Debt Introduced
- None - this is a documentation system with no code dependencies

## Next Steps

### Immediate Follow-ups
- [ ] Start using this system for all new features
- [ ] Train team members on the workflow
- [ ] Get feedback after 2-3 tasks

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Consider adding task status dashboard
- [ ] Create automation scripts for task creation
- [ ] Add task dependency tracking
- [ ] Create epic-level summary documents

### Related Tasks
- Future: Create CLI tool for task management
- Future: Add git hook to ensure plan document exists
- Future: Create task metrics and reporting

## Additional Notes

### Key Decisions
- Used `.mdc` extension for better Cursor integration
- Chose kebab-case for cross-platform compatibility
- Separated plan and summary for clear workflow phases
